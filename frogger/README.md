# Frogger Udacity Project

A simple game created for Udacity's Front End Developer nanodegree program using javascript and HTML5 canvas.

## How to Get Started

Be sure .png files are placed into a folder called "images", place .js files into a folder named "js", and place "index.html" on the top level of the directory structure. 
resources.js loads initial resources such as images and tells the browser to cache reused images to save resources. It also defines the canvas variable. app.js contains custom code and 
creates the enemy and player objects. engine.js runs the requestAnimationFrame game loop and renders the graphics on every loop. 

## How to Play

Use the arrow keys (up, down, left and right) to move the character around the screen. To gain points, bring your character safely to the water at the top of the screen 
without colliding with enemy bugs. If you touch an enemy, the game will resest and your death total will increase.
