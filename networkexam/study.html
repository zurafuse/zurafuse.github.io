<br>

<h3>Multicast Address</h3>
<p>Data packets sent to a multicast address are sent to the entire group of networking devices, such as a group of routers running the same routing protocol</p>
<br>

<h3>How can you match a MAC address with the IP address?</h3><p>if the computers are connected to the same TCP/IP network, you can determine the MAC address through a technology called ARP (Address Resolution Protocol), which is included with TCP/IP. Using ARP, each local network interface tracks both the IP address and MAC address for each device it has recently communicated with. Most computers let you see this list of addresses that ARP has collected.</p>
<br>

<h3>Explain how CSMA/CD works to avoid collisions.</h3>
<p>CSMA/CD works by detecting a collision in the medium and backing off (after transmitting a jam signal) as necessary. Assume, we have a LAN with a number of hosts. When one host wants to transmit a frame, it listens on the medium to check if the medium is busy. Note that absence of any current (or the presence of a residual background current) means no one else is transmitting.</p>

<h3>PATCH CABLE</h3>
<p>A patch cable (item G) is used to make the physical connection from the computer to the wall plate. A patch cable is a short cable used to make the physical connection between networking equipment. There is a 100-meter overall length limitation of the cable run from the telecommunications closet to the networking device in the work area. This includes the length of the patch cables at each end plus the cable run. A general rule of thumb is to allow 90 meters for the cable run from the telecommunications closet to the work area (item E). This allows 5 meters of cable length for the work area and 5 meters for the patch cables in the telecommunications closet (item D) and the work area (item G). Figure 2-5 shows an example of the insides of a telecommunications closet.</p>

<p><strong>cross-connect:</strong> wires connect to different pins. Transmit and receiver wire pairs are crossed.</p>

<h3>Store-and-Forward:</h3><p>In this mode, the entire frame of data is received before any decision is made regarding forwarding the data packet to its destination.</p>
<h3>cut-through:</h3><p>In this mode, the data packet is forwarded to the destination as soon as the destination MAC address has been read. This minimizes the switch latency; however, no error detection is provided by the switch. There are two forms of cut-through switchingâ€”Fast-Forward and Fragment Free.</p>
