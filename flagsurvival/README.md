## How to Play

* Open the game by visiting the demo [here](http://www.zurafuse.com/games/flagsurvival/), or clone/download this repository and open index.html.
* Use Arrow keys to move up, down, left or right. Use the space bar to shoot.
* Defeat enemies by shooting them. Don't let them touch you or your health will decrease. When you health is less than or equal to 0, the game is reset.
* Collect power up items to increase bullet speed, increase bullet frequency, increase the speed of your player, or increase your health.
* Defeating enemies and grabbing power ups increase your score, but the flags that appear around the stage give you more points than anything else. Try to increase your high score each time you play.
