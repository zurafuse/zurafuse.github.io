# JAVASCRIPT CALCULATOR

I created this calculator using javascript. Notice how the size of the calculator changes based on your device. If you are new to javascript, a simple project like this is a great way to become familiar with the language.

## Getting Started

* Open the app by visiting the demo [here](http://zurafuse.com/games/calculator/), or clone/download this repository and open index.html.
* Use your number pad on your keyboard, or click the buttons on the GUI. If you are using a mobile device with no keyboard, you will want to press the buttons on the screen.
* Use the app as you would any calculator.
* Presing "C" clears the memory of the calculator and refreshes the calculations.
